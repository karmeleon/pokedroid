# PokeDroid

Written in APCS in 2011. The code is probably crap, but I'm no Android developer so I don't even know that for sure.

`/server/` contains a (nonfunctional) Java server for the planned multiplayer mode.

`/lwp/` contains the code for the Live Wallpaper.

I'm reuploading it here to preserve it; [it was on SourceForge in a CVS repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pokedroid/), which isn't really supported anymore (although APK downloads are still hosted there). May this code live another ten years.
